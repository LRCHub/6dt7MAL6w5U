Walking out from this place
Pondering the path
The sky is still early dusk
Leaving twilight colors on the clouds
The child next door has sung
The same song three times
Couldn't remember the last words
Keep on repeating the last phrase

I didn't need a beginning or an ending
Your eyes murmured to me
What memory do i need to search
In order to reach into my heart?
The too long days you speak of are like
A one night dream
Not able to believe it will end
The time to awake is still far away

Don't erase a thousand nights
We still can't depart from here

The silent Scherezade
That can't move anyones feelings
No matter how many nights have passed
She can't even speak of one love
Disapeared are the bed time stories
That didn't provide warmth
I wanted to at least
To remember your kind words

Don't erase a thousand nights
As you standing upon a lonely path

I wanted to at least remember those kind words
The thousand nights that disappeared in one night
